# Welcome to my repositoryðŸ˜Ž
My repository is related to course I am currently taking at the University of Auckland called 'stats 220', hence why my repository name is 'stats220'. 
The link to access my repository is https://apra260.github.io/stats220/

## I have created this repository for several reasons:
- for all of my assignment coding projects and files to be in one place
- to ensure that the public can access my projects including potential employers
- to be able to enhance my skills related to coding and creating files
